## useFocusAndBlur

```js
import { useFocusAndBlur } from "@thc-tools/design-system/core/hooks";
```

This hook is to propose a JS managed focus & blur state.

```js
function useFocusAndBlur(disabled = false, onFocus, onBlur) => { focus, setFocus, _handleFocus, _handleBlur };
```

-   disabled `boolean`: If is disabled, will bypass focus state
-   onFocus `func`: Additional custom focus handler
-   onBlur `func`: Additional custom blur handler
-   returns:
    -   focus `boolean`: If is focused
    -   setFocus `func`: Manually set focus state
    -   \_handleFocus `func`: To give to the onFocus event of the component
    -   \_handleBlur `func`: To give to the onBlur event of the component
