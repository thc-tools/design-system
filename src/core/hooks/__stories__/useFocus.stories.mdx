## useFocus

```js
import { useFocus } from "@ds-tools/design-system/core/hooks";
```

This hook is to propose a JS managed focus state.

```js
function useFocus(disabled = false, onFocus) => { focus, setFocus, _handleFocus };
```

-   disabled `boolean`: If is disabled, will bypass focus state
-   onFocus `func`: Additional custom focus handler
-   returns:
    -   focus `boolean`: If is focused
    -   setFocus `func`: Manually set focus state
    -   \_handleFocus `func`: To give to the onFocus event of the component
