## useHover

```js
import { useHover } from "@thc-tools/design-system/core/hooks";
```

This hook is to propose a JS managed hover state.

```js
function useHover(disabled = false, onHover) => { hover, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave };
```

-   disabled `bool`: If is disabled, will bypass hover state
-   onHover `func`: Additional custom hover handler
-   returns:
    -   hover `boolean`: If is hovered
    -   onMouseEnter `func`: To give to the onMouseEnter event of the component
    -   onMouseLeave `func`: To give to the onMouseLeave event of the component
