# How To - Add an element

## Steps to add an element to the system

### Step 1: Verify if it doesn't exists

You may have an idea but ideally we must avoid doubles. Don't forget this rule:

> Every design system elements must be reusable and unique.

So first check here, with the searchbar on the left:

### Step 2: Define a scale for the element

According to the Element Scale table, define if your element is rather a **quark**, an **atom**, a **molecule** or an **organism**.

To help you do that, **try to break down your element into smaller pieces**. What are these pieces ? What are their scale ?

### Step 3: Add an issue on GitHub

Now Step 1 and Step 2 are done, it's time to write down an issue on GitHub !

But before, keep in mind to:

-   Name the element according the Naming Conventions
-   Write down the issue with as many information as you can gather

Now you can use this [>>>MAGIC LINK<<<](https://github.com/ds-tools/feature-proposals/issues/new?assignees=Ephrame%2C+c3dr0x&labels=design+system&template=desgin_system.md&title=ToChange&projects=ds-tools/4)
which will led you to a new issue form with the right template (smooooth).

ℹ️ INFORMATION:

A special Github project was made to track new element addition to the design system.
It is made on root of ds-tools's repos and linked with `technical-proposals` and `feature-proposals`.
