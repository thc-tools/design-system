# Design System 101

## Everything you need to know about design systems

### What is a design system

A design system is a living document helping **developers** and **designers** understand each other.

It's a **single source of truth** about design and components helping a company to scale their product easily.

Basically, it's a **common language** for those who build the product and their users to understand it.

### Why a design system

When it's built and shared, a design system can bring to your design and developer team :

-   A lot of production time saved in design and front-end development
-   A fasten ability to build features
-   A strong consistency and clarity for your product identity
-   To lower the technical dept about components
-   To onboard new developers & designers easily

❗️DISCLAIMER : Not every company need a design system. Design systems must be build on purpose
and to fullfill a need. Following rules above, a small web agency working on short-term projects
(like Ueno) will not have as a strong need of a design system as a single-product-oriented
company (like Doctolib, Alan, Uber...).

### How to build it: The Atomic Design

Atomic design is a method created by Brad Frost in 2016 and popularized in 2018 to frame the
emerging design system hype. It's a simple way to organize design system element from the
smaller to the bigger, using the "atomic" metaphor.

It's the most largest widespread method to build a design system but like every method, we need to
adapt it for ds-tools's organization.
