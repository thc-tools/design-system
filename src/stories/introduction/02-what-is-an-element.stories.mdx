# What is an element ?

## Everything about element scale, rules and naming

### Elements scale

Thanks to Tech & Design teams, we established the following conventions:

| Elements | Definition                                                                                                                                                                       | Developer Translation                 | Examples                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Quark    | An undividable element, it's the smallest element we have.                                                                                                                       | A CSS variable                        | --ds-color-blue        |
| Atom     | A logic group of Quarks used by several molecules as is. Often object (-o) layer in ITCSS                                                                                        | A CSS Classname                       | .ds-o-paper            |
| Molecule | A reusable component with optional variants via props (hover, active, focus, disabled...).<br /><br /> ⚠️ Caution<br /> Every components must have a light and a dark CSS theme. | A React component                     | Card                    |
| Organism | An group of components which act in a functional unit and/or a declinable pattern.                                                                                               | A React component of React components | CardInfos, CardList ... |

All these elements are constituting our design system and they are **only doing display**.

Then our pages ("containers" in the codebase) add data and content to these basic components.

### Elements rules

1. An added element must match with the `Elements Scale definitions`.
2. Every design system elements must be reusable and unique.
3. Our elements must follow the ds-tools Graphic Guidelines.
4. The addition of an element must be motivated by a design/functional need and not be only motivated by a graphic desire.
5. Thanks to this system, no specific CSS will be accepted for a feature development (exceptions : feature/evol testing,
   fast tracks, and if specified in Github)

### Naming Convention

This is the naming convention we built for each kind of element, but before some specific rules :

1. When an attribute must have a size order (eg. text size, spacings...),
   the XS, S, M, L, XL naming convention will be used to categorize sizes.
2. When a name part is longer than 2 words, use camelcase to name it (eg. textsize become textSize)
3. The -layer part of atoms, molecules & organisms follows ITCSS rules.
